# Near deduplication
## For the lastest version of near-deduplication with speed-ups, check [bigcode-dataset/near_deduplication](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-dataset/tree/main/near_deduplication)
Code for running near-deduplication with MinHash and LSH indexing

### Setup

````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Login to be able to be able to push the dataset to the hub after deduplication and clone your huggingface-hub repositories:

````
huggingface-cli login
````

And make sure you have git-lfs installed.

If you use datasets with different column names from the BigCode ones, you might need to change `PATH_COLUMN` and `CONTENT` variables in `minhash_deduplication.py`.

### Usage

To run near deduplication use the following command and adapt the arguments for your case:

````
python near_deduplicate.py \
    --dataset_name bigcode-data/python_any_license_v2 \
    --org bigcode-data \
    --repo_name python_any_license_v2_near_dedup \
    --out_path ./data/any_license-near-dedup \
    --text_column content 
````

To make just a test run with a subset of the data set `test_run` argument to True.

The first time you load the dataset might be slow if it is large, but the data is saved in the cache thanks to `datasets`, and the subsequent calls will be fast.

### Alternative Deduplication Script

`minhash_deduplication_alt.py` is an alternative you might find useful to use as well. It is best for a single multi-core machine environment and uses similar parameters to the original deduplication script.

```bash
pip install -r requirements_alt.txt
# Quick example
python minhash_deduplication_alt.py --dataset codeparrot/codeparrot-clean-valid \  
    --split train \
    --column content \
    --cache-dir .cache \
    --verbose
# For details on the arguments, see the help message
python minhash_deduplication_alt.py --help
```

#### Implementation Analysis

This is for the alternative script that is designed for single-machine setup.

##### Scaling

To understand the limitation of current deduplication implementation, it is important to have an idea of how each step in the pipleine affects the overall time:
1. Minhashing is fast, but it takes loner for long documents. Hashing scales with both the number of cores and single core performance (clock speed, for example). With `datasets`'s caching, it also does not require much memory.
2. Indexing is basically putting minhash signatures into different buckets. This is one bottleneck in this pipleine. In an ideal situation where MapReduce is seamlessly integrated with other parts, it can be further improved with distributed buckets.
3. Depending on how you look at duplicates, querying can be easily created by iterating the buckets or iterating the simhashes.
4. Depending on how you decide to group duplicates, you can build a graph and then do connected component analysis or use simple algorithm like union-find.
5. What to do with a group of duplicates is also a widely open question. We opt to keep one document within a group/cluster in this case.

##### Experiments

We report here some stats on the experiments we did along the way with a 80-core machine on GCP (M1):

For SantaCoder, our results can be replicated by the following commands:

```bash
python minhash_deduplication_alt.py --dataset bigcode/the-stack-dedup-pjj --data-dir data/java --revision v1.1.a1 --cache-dir cache2 --ngram-size 5 --threshold 0.7 --min-token-length 10 --fast
python minhash_deduplication_alt.py --dataset bigcode/the-stack-dedup-pjj --data-dir data/javascript --revision v1.1.a1 --cache-dir cache2 --ngram-size 5 --threshold 0.7 --min-token-length 10 --fast
python minhash_deduplication_alt.py --dataset bigcode/the-stack-dedup-pjj --data-dir data/python --revision v1.1.a1 --cache-dir cache2 --ngram-size 5 --threshold 0.7 --min-token-length 10 --fast
```
