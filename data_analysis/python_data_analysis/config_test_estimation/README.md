# Config and test files detection

Here we provide the code to detect and estimate the number of configuration and test files in a code dataset.

You can execute the code using:
```bash
python config_test.py --dataset_name <dataset_name> --split <split>
```
where `dataset_name` is the name of the dataset you want to analyze and `split` is the dataset split.
